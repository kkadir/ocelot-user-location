# API Gateway: Ocelot and .NET Core
This is a sample project to build a containerized Ocelot API Gateway with basic features.

## 1st Iteration: Setting Up Ocelot
In this iteration, our focus will be setting up and manage to run Ocelot on Docker container(s) locally so we only have dummy API services.
